\section{The Diversity of Workflow Models}\label{workflows}

One of the most challenging aspects of studying workflows is the way the
vocabulary has been unintentionally overloaded.  It is easier to
understand workflows by starting from a historical perspective.

The use and study of workflows and the initial implementation of workflow
management systems (i.e., systems that manage one or more activities related to
workflows), and especially workflow execution, was developed in the business
world to addres the need to automate business processes. Lud\"{a}scher et~al. 
ascribe the origins of workflows and workflow management systems to ``office
automation'' trends in the 1970s \cite{ludascher_scientific_2006}.
Van~Der~Aalst argues that ``workflows'' arose from the needs of businesses not
only to execute tasks but also ``to manage the flow of work through
the organization,'' and managing workflows is the natural evolution from the
monolithic applications of the 1960s to applications that rely on external
functionality in the 1990s \cite{van_der_aalst_application_1998}. By 1995, in
the presence of many workflow tools, the Workflow Management Coalition had
developed a ``standard'' definition of workflows
\cite{hollingsworth_workflow_1993}:

\begin{displayquote} A workflow is the automation of a business process, in
whole or part, during which documents, information or tasks are passed from one
participant (a resource; human or machine) to another for action, according a
set of procedural rules.  \end{displayquote}

In the early 2000s, workflow systems started finding use in scientific contexts
where process automation was required for scientific uses instead of traditional
business uses. At the time, the focus of scientific workflows also shifted to
focus primarily on data processing and managing heterogeneous infrastructure for
large ``grids'' of networked services \cite{yu_taxonomy_2005}. Yu and Buyya
define a workflow as \todo{Make sure usage of ``grid workflow'' is consistent
across the document.}

\begin{displayquote}. . .  a collection of tasks that are processed on
distributed resources in a well-defined order to accomplish a specific
goal.\end{displayquote}

This latter definition is important because of what is missing: the human
element. For many in the grid/eScience workflows community this has become the
standard definition of a workflow and the involvement of humans results not in a
single workflow but in multiple workflows spanned by a human.  Machines or
instruments are absent from the definition as well, but in practice many modern
grid workflows are launched automatically when data ``comes off'' of instruments
because they remain the primary source of data in grid workflows
(cf.~\cite{megino_panda:_2015}).

In addition to grid workflows, the scientific community started exploring
``modeling and simulation workflows,'' which focus not on data flow but on the
orchestration of activities related to modeling and simulation,
sometimes on small local computers, but often on the largest of the world's
leadership-class supercomputers. Unlike grid workflows, they tend to require
human interaction in one way or another.  Some of these workflows are defined
in the context of a particular way of working, such as the Automation, Data,
Environment, and Sharing model of Pizzi et~al. \cite{pizzi_aiida:_2016}, the
Design-to-Analysis model of Clay et~al. \cite{clay_incorporating_2015}, or the
model of Billings et~al. \cite{billings_eclipse_2017}.

Additional types of workflows in the scientific community include workflows that
process ensembles of calculations for uncertainty quantification, verification
and validation, or probabilistic risk assessment \cite{montoya_apex_2016} and
workflows used for testing software. These workflows share the property
that they are all running a very large set of coordinated jobs that provide
value only when run together. However, they differ because testing workflows
typically run each test as an independent task, whereas the other workflows may
or may not change the tasks that are executed based on the intermediate state of
the entire ensemble. These workflows require a large cluster or possibly a
supercomputer in extreme cases.

Many scientific workflows have been hard-coded into dedicated environments---not
general-purpose workflow management systems---that serve as point solutions
developed for the sole purpose of that single well-defined workflow, or at most
a few workflows, to meet the needs of a single community. This leads to an
important defining characteristic for workflow management systems versus
point solutions: Workflow management systems are extensible through a public
application programming interface (API) or other method, and extension does not,
in general, require the intervention of the original author. Embedding workflows
into point solutions may be the best solution in many cases, but the
distinction between point solutions and full workflow management systems is
important because it clearly demonstrates  that some parties prefer to focus on
rapidly creating new or modifying old workflows, whereas others may be
interested only in executing well-defined, very stable workflows.

Finally, an important class of scientific workflows is the set of ``conceptual
workflows'' that broadly define activities based on the policies of a given
community. These are common in large collaborations such as the Community Earth
System Model \cite{noauthor_cesm_nodate}. These workflows describe a
series of activities that contain both human- and computer-controlled tasks
and look like business workflows. However, depending on the author, the level
of detail tends to oscillate between very high and very low, as does the degree
of abstraction. These workflows are important because they are often referred
to in the same discussions as the other types of workflows described previously.
This illustrates the important fact that not all scientific workflows are
machine executable, and it may be impossible to automate them in a workflow
management system, even one that is very good at defining abstract workflows.
It also demonstrates the difficulties that can arise in a discussion about
workflows because of ambiguity in the definition.

\subsection{Taxonomies and Classification}\label{taxonomies-and-classification}
Several efforts have been made to classify, survey, or develop taxonomies for
workflows and workflow management systems, and these efforts are significant in
large part because they represent a collective call for developing higher-order
concepts in the space. Yu and Buyya present an exceptional taxonomy for grid
workflows. Several other efforts provide highly useful vocabularies and
analyses as well.

Yu and Buyya developed a taxonomy for workflow management systems on grids that
sought to capture the architectural style and identify comparison criteria
\cite{yu_taxonomy_2005}. Their work is notable because it largely avoids a
discussion of workflows per se and focuses purely on the functional
properties of the workflow management systems as they exist on the grids. Their
work also shows how 13 common grid workflow management systems, including
Pegasus and Kepler, fit into the taxonomy. Like other authors, Yu and Buyya
cite the lack of standardized workflow syntax and language as sources of
interoperability issues.

Scientific workflow management systems have flourished since their inception,
although not without significant overlap and duplication of effort. The survey
of scientific workflow management systems by Barker and Hemert illustrates both
growth and growing pains but also provides important observations and
recommendations on the topic \cite{barker_scientific_2007}.

Barker and Hemert also provide key insights into the history of workflow
management systems as an important part of business automation. The authors make
an important comparison between traditional business workflow management systems
and their scientific counterparts, citing in particular that traditional
business workflow tools employ the wrong abstraction for scientists. They define
workflows using the ``standard'' definition from the Workflow Management
Coalition (cf.~\S \ref{workflows}).

The discussion points that Barker and Hemert raise are important because of
their continuing importance and relevance today, particularly the need to enable
programmability through standard languages instead of custom proprietary
languages. Sticking to standards is important and is perhaps illustrated best
by Barker's and Hemert's statement:

\begin{displayquote} If software development and tool support terminates on one
proprietary framework, workflows will need to be re-implemented from scratch.
\end{displayquote}

This point is important even for workflow tools that do not use proprietary
standards but develop their own solutions. What can be done to support those
tools and reproduce those workflows once support for continued development ends?

Montoya et~al. discuss workflow needs for the Alliance for Application
Performance at Extreme Scale (APEX) \cite{nersc_apex_2016} and describe three
main classes of workflows: simulation science, uncertainty quantification,
and high-throughput computing (HTC) \cite{montoya_apex_2016}.  HTC workflows
start with the collection of data from experiments that is in turn transported
to large compute facilities for processing. Many grid workflows are HTC
workflows, but not all HTC workflows are grid workflows since some HTC
workflows---such as those presented by Montoya et~al.---can be run on large
resources that are not traditionally ``grid machines.'' When Montoya et~al.
describe scientific workflows, they are refering to the modeling and simulation
workflows described previously. Montoya et~al. also provide a detailed mapping
of each workflow type to optimal hardware resources for the APEX program.

The US Department of Energy (DOE) sponsored the DOE NGNS/CS Scientific
Workflows Workshop on April 20--21, 2015. In the report, Deelman et~al.
describe the requirements and research directions for scientific workflows for
the exascale environment \cite{deelman_future_2015}\cite{deelman_future_2017}.
The report describes scientific workflows primarily by three
application types: simulations, instruments, and collaborations. The findings of
the workshop are comprehensive and encouraging, with recommendations for
research priorities in application requirements, hardware systems, system
software, workflow management system design and execution, programming and
usability, provenance capture, validation, and workflow science.

The definitions of a workflow and workflow management systems are
thoroughly explored and put into context for the purposes of the workshop. The
authors of the report are very careful to define workflows not just as a
collection of managed processes, which is common, but in such a way that it is
clear that reproducibility, mobility, and some degree of generality are required
by both the description of the workflow and the management system. (n.b. The
report appears to provide three separate definitions for ``workflow'' on pages
6, 9, and 10.)


Atkinson et~al. \cite{atkinson-csur} discuss how to make in~silico
experiments more manageable by modeling them as workflows and how to use a
workflow management system to organize their execution. They attribute the four
primary challenge  of workflow execution to (i) the complexity and diversity of
applications; (ii) the diversity of analysis goals; (iii) the heterogeneity of
computing platforms, and (iv) the volume and distribution of data. They also
propose a taxonomy of workflow management system characteristics.

Ferreira da~Silva et~al. attempt to characterize workflow management systems in
\cite{ferreira_da_silva_characterization_nodate}. The authors reduce key
properties of workflow systems into four incongruent areas: (i) design, (ii)
execution and monitoring, (iii) reusability, and (iv) collaboration. These
properties are essential considerations for most  software with limited
specificity for workflow management systems. Furthermore, there is general
conflation between classification and taxonomy and significant incoherence
between entries in equivalence classes. Most significantly, it fluctuates
somewhat chaotically between discussing workflows and workflow management
systems without linking workflow properties to the successful design and properties
of workflow systems.
