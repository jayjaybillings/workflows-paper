Dept. of Energy has launched an initiative to revamp and modernize the role that modeling and simulation plays in the development and operation of nuclear facilities. This Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation (NEAMS) program represents a major investment in the development of new software, with one or more large multi-scale multi-physics capabilities in each of four technical areas associated with the nuclear fuel cycle, as well as additional supporting developments. In conjunction with this, we are designing a software architecture, computational environment, and component framework to integrate the NEAMS technical capabilities and make them more accessible to users. In this report of work very much in progress, we lay out the "problem" we are addressing, describe the model-driven system design approach we are using, and compare them with several large-scale technical software initiatives from the past. We discuss how component technology may be uniquely positioned to address the software integration challenges of the NEAMS program, outline the capabilities planned for the NEAMS computational environment and framework, and describe some initial prototyping activities.},

	abstract = {Building a new generation of fission reactors in the United States presents many technical and regulatory challenges. One important challenge is the need to share and present results from new high-fidelity, high-performance simulations in an easily usable way. Since modern multiscale, multi-physics simulations can generate petabytes of data, they will require the development of new techniques and methods to reduce the data to familiar quantities of interest (e.g., pin powers, temperatures) with a more reasonable resolution and size. Furthermore, some of the results from these simulations may be new quantities for which visualization and analysis techniques are not immediately available in the community and need to be developed.

This paper describes a new system for managing high-performance simulation results in a domain-specific way that naturally exposes quantities of interest for light water and sodium-cooled fast reactors. It describes requirements to build such a system and the technical challenges faced in its development at all levels (simulation, user interface, etc.). An example comparing results from two different simulation suites for a single assembly in a light-water reactor is presented, along with a detailed discussion of the system’s requirements and design.},

The recent availability of adiabatic hardware has raised challenging questions about how to evaluate adiabatic quantum optimization (AQO) programs. Processor behavior depends on multiple steps to synthesize an adiabatic quantum program, which are each highly tunable. We present an integrated programming and development environment for AQO called Jade Adiabatic Development Environment (JADE) that provides control over all the steps taken during program synthesis. JADE captures the workflow needed to rigorously specify the AQO algorithm while allowing a variety of problem types, programming techniques, and processor configurations. We have also integrated JADE with a quantum simulation engine that enables program profiling using numerical calculation. The computational engine supports plug-ins for simulation methodologies tailored to various metrics and computing resources. We present the design, integration, and deployment of JADE and discuss its potential use for benchmarking AQO programs by the quantum computer science community.},

Gaining an understanding of the role of these processes as well as development of predictive capabilities for design of better performing batteries requires synergy between theory, modeling, and simulation, and fundamental experimental work to support the models. This paper presents the overview of the work performed by the authors aligned with both experimental and computational efforts. In this paper, we describe a new, open source computational environment for battery simulations with an initial focus on lithium-ion systems but designed to support a variety of model types and formulations. This system has been used to create a three-dimensional cell and battery pack models that explicitly simulate all the battery components (current collectors, electrodes, and separator). The models are used to predict battery performance under normal operations and to study thermal and mechanical safety aspects under adverse conditions. This paper also provides an overview of the experimental techniques to obtain crucial validation data to benchmark the simulations at various scales for performance as well as abuse. We detail some initial validation using characterization experiments such as infrared and neutron imaging and micro-Raman mapping. In addition, we identify opportunities for future integration of theory, modeling, and experiments.},

	abstract = {Pilot-Job systems play an important role in supporting distributed scientific computing. They are used to consume more than 700 million CPU hours a year by the Open Science Grid communities, and by processing up to 1 million jobs a day for the ATLAS experiment on the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid. With the increasing importance of task-level parallelism in high-performance computing, Pilot-Job systems are also witnessing an adoption beyond traditional domains. Notwithstanding the growing impact on scientific research, there is no agreement upon a definition of Pilot-Job system and no clear understanding of the underlying abstraction and paradigm. Pilot-Job implementations have proliferated with no shared best practices or open interfaces and little interoperability. Ultimately, this is hindering the realization of the full impact of Pilot-Jobs by limiting their robustness, portability, and maintainability. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of Pilot-Job systems critically assessing their motivations, evolution, properties, and implementation. The three main contributions of this paper are: (i) an analysis of the motivations and evolution of Pilot-Job systems; (ii) an outline of the Pilot abstraction, its distinguishing logical components and functionalities, its terminology, and its architecture pattern; and (iii) the description of core and auxiliary properties of Pilot-Jobs systems and the analysis of seven exemplar Pilot-Job implementations. Together, these contributions illustrate the Pilot paradigm, its generality, and how it helps to address some challenges in distributed scientific computing.},

	abstract = {The ability to support Quality of Service (QoS) constraints is an important requirement in some scientific applications. With the increasing use of Cloud computing infrastructures, where access to resources is shared, dynamic and provisioned on-demand, identifying how QoS constraints can be supported becomes an important challenge. However, access to dedicated resources is often not possible in existing Cloud deployments and limited QoS guarantees are provided by many commercial providers (often restricted to error rate and availability, rather than particular QoS metrics such as latency or access time). We propose a workflow system architecture which enforces QoS for the simultaneous execution of multiple scientific workflows over a shared infrastructure (such as a Cloud environment). Our approach involves multiple pipeline workflow instances, with each instance having its own QoS requirements. These workflows are composed of a number of stages, with each stage being mapped to one or more physical resources. A stage involves a combination of data access, computation and data transfer capability. A token bucket-based data throttling framework is embedded into the workflow system architecture. Each workflow instance stage regulates the amount of data that is injected into the shared resources, allowing for bursts of data to be injected while at the same time providing isolation of workflow streams. We demonstrate our approach by using the Montage workflow, and develop a Reference net model of the workflow.},

	abstract = {In a scientific workflow system, a checkpoint selection strategy is used to select checkpoints along scientific workflow execution for verifying temporal constraints so that we can identify any temporal violations and handle them in time in order to ensure overall temporal correctness of the execution that is often essential for the usefulness of execution results. The problem of existing representative strategies is that they do not differentiate temporal constraints as, once a checkpoint is selected, they verify all temporal constraints. However, such a checkpoint does not need to be taken for those constraints whose consistency can be deduced from others. The corresponding verification of such constraints is consequently unnecessary and can severely impact overall temporal verification efficiency while the efficiency determines whether temporal violations can be identified quickly for handling in time. To address the problem, in this article, we develop a new temporal-dependency based checkpoint selection strategy which can select checkpoints in accordance with different temporal constraints. With our strategy, the corresponding unnecessary verification can be avoided. The comparison and experimental simulation further demonstrate that our new strategy can improve the efficiency of overall temporal verification significantly over the existing representative strategies.},

	abstract = {The proliferation of commercial cloud computing providers has generated significant interest in the scientific computing community. Much recent research has attempted to determine the benefits and drawbacks of cloud computing for scientific applications. Although clouds have many attractive features, such as virtualization, on-demand provisioning, and "pay as you go" usage-based pricing, it is not clear whether they are able to deliver the performance required for scientific applications at a reasonable price. In this paper we examine the performance and cost of clouds from the perspective of scientific workflow applications. We use three characteristic workflows to compare the performance of a commercial cloud with that of a typical HPC system, and we analyze the various costs associated with running those workflows in the cloud. We find that the performance of clouds is not unreasonable given the hardware resources provided, and that performance comparable to HPC systems can be achieved given similar resources. We also find that the cost of running workflows on a commercial cloud can be reduced by storing data in the cloud rather than transferring it from outside.},

The BWW representation model attempts to provide a theoretical base on which to evaluate and thus contribute to the improvement of information systems modeling techniques. The analysis conducted in this paper prompts some propositions. It confirms that the process view alone is not sufficient to model all the real-world constructs required. Some other symbols or views are needed to overcome these deficiencies. However, even when considering all five views in combination, problems may arise in representing all potentially required business rules, specifying the scope and boundaries of the system under consideration, and employing a “top-down” approach to analysis and design. Further work from this study will involve the operationalization of these propositions and their empirical testing in the field.},

They facilitate access to remote instruments, databases and parallel and distributed computers. Importantly, they allow software pipelines that perform multiple complex simulations (leveraging distributed platforms), with one simulation driving another. Such an environment is ideal for computational science experiments that require the evaluation of a range of different scenarios “in silico” in an attempt to find ones that optimize a particular outcome. However, in general, existing workflow tools do not incorporate optimization algorithms, and thus whilst users can specify simulation pipelines, they need to invoke the workflow as a stand-alone computation within an external optimization tool. Moreover, many existing workflow engines do not leverage parallel and distributed computers, making them unsuitable for executing computational science simulations. To solve this problem, we have developed a methodology for integrating optimization algorithms directly into workflows. We implement a range of generic actors for an existing workflow system called Kepler, and discuss how they can be combined in flexible ways to support various different design strategies. We illustrate the system by applying it to an existing bio-engineering design problem running on a Grid of distributed clusters.},

A related trend is that more and more scientific communities realize the benefits of sharing their data and computational services, and are thus contributing to a distributed data and computational community infrastructure (a.k.a. ‘the Grid’). However, this infrastructure is only a means to an end and ideally scientists should not be too concerned with its existence. The goal is for scientists to focus on development and use of what we call scientific workflows. These are networks of analytical steps that may involve, e.g., database access and querying steps, data analysis and mining steps, and many other steps including computationally intensive jobs on high-performance cluster computers. In this paper we describe characteristics of and requirements for scientific workflows as identified in a number of our application projects. We then elaborate on Kepler, a particular scientific workflow system, currently under development across a number of scientific data management projects. We describe some key features of Kepler and its underlying Ptolemy II system, planned extensions, and areas of future research. Kepler is a community-driven, open source project, and we always welcome related projects and new contributors to join. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In scientific workflow systems, due to the dynamic nature of the underlying computing infrastructures such as grid and cloud, execution delays often take place and result in a large number of temporal violations. Since temporal violation handling is expensive in terms of both monetary costs and time overheads, an essential question aroused is “do we need to handle every temporal violation in scientific workflow systems?” The answer would be “true” according to existing works on workflow temporal management which adopt the philosophy similar to the handling of functional exceptions, that is, every temporal violation should be handled whenever it is detected. However, based on our observation, the phenomenon of self-recovery where execution delays can be automatically compensated for by the saved execution time of subsequent workflow activities has been entirely overlooked. Therefore, considering the nonfunctional nature of temporal violations, our answer is “not necessarily true.” To take advantage of self-recovery, this article proposes a novel adaptive temporal violation handling point selection strategy where this phenomenon is effectively utilised to avoid unnecessary temporal violation handling. Based on simulations of both real-world scientific workflows and randomly generated test cases, the experimental results demonstrate that our strategy can significantly reduce the cost on temporal violation handling by over 96\% while maintaining extreme low violation rate under normal circumstances.},

	abstract = {In many data-driven applications, analysis needs to be performed on scientific information obtained from several sources and generated by computations on distributed resources. Systematic analysis of this scientific information unleashes a growing need for automated data-driven applications that also can keep track of the provenance of the data and processes with little user interaction and overhead. Such data analysis can be facilitated by the recent advancements in scientific workflow systems. A major profit when using scientific workflow systems is the ability to make provenance collection a part of the workflow. Specifically, provenance should include not only the standard data lineage information but also information about the context in which the workflow was used, execution that processed the data, and the evolution of the workflow design. In this paper we describe a complete framework for data and process provenance in the Kepler Scientific Workflow System. We outline the requirements and issues related to data and workflow provenance in a multi-disciplinary workflow system and introduce how generic provenance capture can be facilitated in Kepler’s actor-oriented workflow environment. We also describe the usage of the stored provenance information for efficient rerun of scientific workflows.},

To support business-to-business operations, an information system (IS) with an embedded workflow management component is needed. The inherent characteristics of such a system makes it suitable to implement cross-organization management. Nowadays, however, these system additions are not common. When developing a supply chain management (SCM) system for a large motorcycle corporation in China, we had to construct an inter-enterprise architecture using the internet. The main part of this is a workflow-supported inner supply chain system and an integrated interface. In it, the business processes are defined and executed by the supply chain management system. The independent inner systems are connected by the integrated interface into a large, global, supply chain manage system to management business processes across the independent enterprises. This paper presents the system design and implementation and discusses our experiences and lessons learned.},

MapReduce and its de facto open source project, called Hadoop, support parallel processing on large datasets with capabilities including automatic data partitioning and distribution, load balancing, and fault tolerance management. Meanwhile, scientific workflow management systems, e.g., Kepler, Taverna, Triana, and Pegasus, have demonstrated their ability to help domain scientists solve scientific problems by synthesizing different data and computing resources. By integrating Hadoop with Kepler, we provide an easy-to-use architecture that facilitates users to compose and execute MapReduce applications in Kepler scientific workflows. Our implementation demonstrates that many characteristics of scientific workflow management systems, e.g., graphical user interface and component reuse and sharing, are very complementary to those of MapReduce. Using the presented Hadoop components in Kepler, scientists can easily utilize MapReduce in their domain-specific problems and connect them with other tasks in a workflow through the Kepler graphical user interface. We validate the feasibility of our approach via a word count use case.},

Notwithstanding this prevalence and impact, it is often still performed using the renaissance model of individual artisans gathered in a workshop, under the guidance of an established practitioner. Great benefits could follow instead from adopting concepts and tools coming from computer science to manage, preserve, and share these computational efforts. We illustrate here our paradigm sustaining such vision, based around the four pillars of Automation, Data, Environment, and Sharing. We then discuss its implementation in the open-source AiiDA platform (http://www.aiida.net), that has been tuned first to the demands of computational materials science. AiiDA’s design is based on directed acyclic graphs to track the provenance of data and calculations, and ensure preservation and searchability. Remote computational resources are managed transparently, and automation is coupled with data storage to ensure reproducibility. Last, complex sequences of calculations can be encoded into scientific workflows. We believe that AiiDA’s design and its sharing capabilities will encourage the creation of social ecosystems to disseminate codes, data, and scientific workflows.},

	abstract = {The development of parallel applications is becoming increasingly important to a broad range of industries. Traditionally, parallel programming was a niche area that was primarily exploited by scientists trying to model extremely complicated physical phenomenon. It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that continued hardware performance improvements through clock scaling and feature-size reduction are simply not going to be achievable for much longer. The hardware vendor's approach to addressing this issue is to employ parallelism through multi-processor and multi-core technologies. While there is little doubt that this approach produces scaling improvements, there are still many significant hurdles to be overcome before parallelism can be employed as a general replacement to more traditional programming techniques. The Parallel Tools Platform (PTP) Project was created in 2005 in an attempt to provide developers with new tools aimed at addressing some of the parallel development issues. Since then, the introduction of a new generation of peta-scale and multi-core systems has highlighted the need for such a platform. In this paper, we describe some of the challenges facing parallel application developers, present the current state of PTP, and provide a simple case study that demonstrates how PTP can be used to locate a potential deadlock situation in an MPI code.},

	abstract = {Human beings are information omnivores: we are constantly collecting, labeling, and organizing data. But today, the shift from the physical to the digital is mixing, burning, and ripping our lives apart. In the past, everything had its one place--the physical world demanded it--but now everything has its places: multiple categories, multiple shelves. Simply put, everything is suddenly miscellaneous. In Everything Is Miscellaneous, David Weinberger charts the new principles of digital order that are remaking business, education, politics, science, and culture. In his rollicking tour of the rise of the miscellaneous, he examines why the Dewey decimal system is stretched to the breaking point, how Rand McNally decides what information not to include in a physical map (and why Google Earth is winning that battle), how Staples stores emulate online shopping to increase sales, why your childrens teachers will stop having them memorize facts, and how the shift to digital music stands as the model for the future in virtually every industry. Finally, he shows how by "going miscellaneous," anyone can reap rewards from the deluge of information in modern work and life. From A to Z, Everything Is Miscellaneous will completely reshape the way you think--and what you know--about the world. The Flocking of Information: An Amazon.com Exclusive Essay by David Weinberger As businesses go miscellaneous, information gets chopped into smaller and smaller pieces. But it also escapes its leash--adding to a pile that can be sorted and arranged by anyone with a Web browser and a Net connection. In fact, information exhibits bird-like "flocking behavior," joining with other information that adds value to it, creating swarms that help customers and, ultimately, the businesses from which the information initially escaped. For example, Wize.com is a customer review site founded in 2005 by entrepreneur Doug Baker. The site provides reviews for everything from computers and MP3 players to coffee makers and baby strollers. But why do we need another place for reviews? If youre using the Web to research what digital camera to buy for your father-in-law, you probably feel there are far too many sites out there already. By the time you have scrolled through one stores customer reviews for each candidate camera and then cross-referenced the positive and the negative with the expert reviews at each of your bookmarked consumer magazines, you have to start the process again just to remember what people said. Wize in fact aims at exactly that problem. It pulls together reviews from many outside sources and aggregates them into three piles: user reviews, expert reviews (with links to the online publications), and the general "buzz." (For shoppers looking for a quick read on a product, Wize assigns an overall ranking.) When Wize reports that 97 percent of users love the Nikon D200 camera, it includes links to the online stores where the user reviews are posted, so customers are driven back to the businesses to spend their money. Zillow.com does something similar for real estate. The people behind Expedia.com, Rich Barton and Lloyd Frink, were looking for a new business idea--and were in the market for new homes. After hunting for information, they found that most of it was locked into the multiple listings sites of the National Association of Realtors. Now Zillow takes those listings and mashes them up with additional information that can help a potential purchaser find exactly what she wants. The most dramatic mashup right now is the "heat map" that uses swaths of color to let you tell at a glance what are the most expensive and most affordable areas. At some point, though, Zillow or one of its emerging competitors will mash up listing information with school ratings, crime maps, and aircraft flight patterns. Wize and Zillow make money by selling advertising, but their value is in the way their sites aggregate the miscellaneous--letting lots of independent sources flock together, all in one place. Were seeing the same trend in industry after industry, including music, travel, and the news media. Information gets released into the wild (sometimes against a companys will), where it joins up with other information, and the act of aggregating adds value. Companies lose some control, but they gain market presence and smarter customers. The companies that are succeeding in the new digital skies are the ones that allow their customers to add their own information and the aggregators to mix it up, because whether or not information wants to be free, it sure wants to flock.},

	abstract = {Workflow management promises a new solution to an age-old problem: controlling, monitoring, optimizing and supporting business processes. What is new about workflow management is the explicit representation of the business process logic which allows for computerized support. This paper discusses the use of Petri nets in the context of workflow management. Petri nets are an established tool for modeling and analyzing processes. On the one hand, Petri nets can be used as a design language for the specification of complex workflows. On the other hand, Petri net theory provides for powerful analysis techniques which can be used to verify the correctness of workflow procedures. This paper introduces workflow management as an application domain for Petri nets, presents state-of-the-art results with respect to the verification of workflows, and highlights some Petri-net-based workflow tools.},

	abstract = {The Large Hadron Collider(LHC) is the world's largest and most powerful machine. It started operating in 2009 with a scientific program foreseen to extend over the next coming decades at increasing energies and luminosities to maximise the discovery potential. During Run1 (2009- 2013), the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) successfully delivered all the necessary computing resources, which made the discovery of the Higgs Boson possible. Looking ahead, it is forecasted that increased luminosities will extrapolate to a multiplicity in the storage and processing costs, which is not reflected in a corresponding funding growth of the WLCG. ATLAS, one of the four experiments at the LHC, is therefore leading an upgrade program to evolve their software and computing model to make the best possible usage of available resources, and also leverage on upcoming state of the art computing paradigms that could make important resource contributions. These proceedings will give an insight into the accompanying work in PanDA, ATLAS’ workload management system. PanDA has implemented event level bookkeeping and dynamic generation of jobs with tailored lengths, in order to integrate and optimise the usage of oppor- tunistic resources, e.g. Cloud Computing or High Performance Computing (HPC). In conjunc- tion, the Event Service has been developed as a way to manage fine grained jobs and its outputs. Usage examples on some of the leading commercial and research infrastructures will be given. In addition, we will describe the work on further exploiting the current network capabilities by allowing remote data access and reducing regional boundaries.},
