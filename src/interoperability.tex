There are several related but distinct concepts that require further
consideration:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Distributed workflow system interoperability that executes a
large workflow across multiple workflow management systems. 
\item Workflow transferability that uses the same workflows to solve different
science problems.
\item Execution delegation of workflows to systems that can execute workflow
not supported by the original system. 
\item Interchangeable workflow systems and components that can
equally execute the same workflows regardless of origin, domain,
or other distinguishing factors.
\end{enumerate} 

A primary driver for seeking interoperability across workflow systems (the
first case) has been the need to address larger scientific problems that can
be solved only with workflows that require multiple systems for complete
execution. Two successful examples of limited interoperability between workflow
systems are discussed in \cite{brooks_triquetrum:_2015} and
\cite{mandal_integrating_2007}. Notably, both projects leveraged flavors of the
Ptolemy framework, namely Triquetrum and Kepler, and delegated the execution of
workflows.
